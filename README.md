# simple-example-API-php-for-mychanger.icu-
This is a simple php example for API data exchange for stores that will work with muchanger.icu.
This is a simple example of how shops or partners interact with the https://mychanger.icu project
It does not require any special installation, just install it on the server, open the URL of the site where it is installed in the browser.
There are several forms that are the main ones for the work of the https://mychanger.icu project with contractors.
This repository is an example in PHP, but the project can work with absolutely any project that can accept and send post requests.
To work, you need to contact the site administration to get access to your personal account and generate a new API KEY and SECRET KEY for yourself there, and your store ID data will also be there.
Further, in the same place, you need to configure all the other data, this is the site url, the page for processing requests from the store. Pages of successful and unsuccessful processing of the store are needed to redirect users who pay for this project.
